## Hi there, I'm Tommaso 👋 

I'm a Fullstack Developer currently Building on the Stellar blockchain with 5 years of experience in Software Development (though I created this github account only in 2020).

#### Current areas of interest:
- Decentralised finance
- Designing and Implementing Innovative governance models
- Integrating blockchain technology on everyday apps
- Financial machine learning
- Blockchain-based Encryption mechanisms


### I'm Open For:
Currently, I am only open to small freelance tasks since I am working almost full-time on some personal projects I intend to scale and bring together in a single corporation. (I will publish information about these project on June 6th once I have hopefully submitted them to the SCF)
