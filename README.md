## Hi there, I'm Tommaso

I'm a developer that knows his way around front-end development in Svelte, but I'm mostly working on APIs, apps on the Stellar Network, WASM, and decentralized finance.

#### Current areas of interest:
- Distributed Ledger Technology
- Decentralized financial instruments
- SaaS
- WebAssembly
- zero knowledge proofs

I'm also curious about FinML, but don't work on the field often. 

#### Used Languages
I am mostly workin with `Javascript` and `Rust`. I also know `Python` and some `WASM text format`, but don't use them often. I should also mention that I use `.wat` only use for researching and debugging WASM (understanding it's behaviour in terms of memory, locate optimizable parts, avoid vulnerabilities).


#### Currently Working On
I'm always available for freelance tasks (mostly on the Stellar Network), but my primary focus is currently on building products for [[Xycloo]](https://xycloo.com/). I'm currently building [[AgoraBet]](https://agorabet.xycloo.com), a decentralized and incredibly efficient prediction market, [[sTeX]](https://stex.xycloo.com/), a cloud-based LaTeX editor with a google docs alike UX and UI, and a decentralized marketplace on the Stellar Network for tokenised documents that will be integrated within sTeX. At Xycloo, we are also prototyping the creation of decentralized financial instruments on the Stellar Network, but given the fact that Soroban smart contracts are not even on the testnet yet, we have decided not to announce those project(s) yet.

Besides projects, I'm constantly doing research in the field of WASM security (Rust is safer!) and actively working with the first early release of Stellar's smart contracts: Soroban.

I have also a Medium blog with about `1.4K` followers, go check it <https://tdep.medium.com/>.

#### Security Finidngs Acknowledgments

I've also done some bug bounty. These are companies that acknowledged, and some also rewarded my research on their code: `Google` (acknowledged + rewarded), `Valve` (acknowledged + rewarded), `Wickr` (acknowledged + rewarded), `BBC` (acknowledged + rewarded(swag)), `Dashlane` (acknowledged + rewarded), `UIPath` (acknowledged + rewarded), `Acronis` (acknowledged + rewarded), `Basecamp` (acknowledged + rewarded), `Via` (acknowledged + rewarded), `Courier` (acknowledged, duplicate)
