I'm a developer from 🇮🇹 with interests in:

- 🦾 **Deep Learning**  &#8594; I'm currently focusing in learning everything about Time Series.
- 🕸 **Backend & API Development** &#8594; I like building Backends and APIs with Django, I've worked with both REST and GraphQL.
- 🤖 **Web Automation** &#8594; When possible using my knowledge with APIs, and when not, using Selenium.
- 🐞 **Security Research** &#8594; I've also had a good experience with Web/Mobile/API security research. That's because I sometimes enjoy doing Bug Bounties
