## Hi there, I'm Tommaso

I'm a developer that knows his way around front-end development in Svelte, but I'm mostly working on APIs, apps on the Stellar Network, WASM, and decentralized finance.

#### Current areas of interest:
- Distributed Ledger Technology
- Decentralized financial instruments
- SaaS
- WebAssembly
- zero knowledge proofs

I'm also curious about FinML, but I never got to work concretely on the field. 

#### Used Languages
I am mostly working with `Rust` and `Javascript`, but lately I'd say 90% of my code has been Rust. I also know `Python` and I've played around with `Elixir`, but I rarely use theem.


#### Currently ðŸ¥¬
I may be up to freelance tasks (mostly on the Stellar Network), but my primary focus is currently building stuff over at [Xycloo](https://xycloo.com/). 
Given the potential I think the [Stellar Network](https://stellar.org/) has in the near future with the release of [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org/), I've been working closely with Soroban smart contracts since the August early release. With Soroban now being in testing phase on Futurenet, I've started submitting smart contract examples, guides and tools, which led to create Xycloo's [soroban-guide](https://github.com/xycloo/soroban-guide) and [soroban-explorer](https://github.com/xycloo/soroban-explorer). These submissions and interests in Soroban also eventually led me to be part of the team building Soroban's [Stellar Quest](https://quest.stellar.org), which is an excellent place to start your Soroban journey (aside from the docs).

Besides playing with smart contracts, at Xycloo we have built proof-of-concept apps such as [Tmyxer](https://github.com/xycloo/tmyxer), and are building [sTeX](https://stex.xycloo.com/).

#### Security Finidngs Acknowledgments

I've also done some bug bounty. These are companies that acknowledged, and some also rewarded my research on their code: `Google` (acknowledged + rewarded), `Valve` (acknowledged + rewarded), `Wickr` (acknowledged + rewarded), `BBC` (acknowledged + rewarded(swag)), `Dashlane` (acknowledged + rewarded), `UIPath` (acknowledged + rewarded), `Acronis` (acknowledged + rewarded), `Basecamp` (acknowledged + rewarded), `Via` (acknowledged + rewarded), `Courier` (acknowledged, duplicate)
