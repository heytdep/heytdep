I'm a developer from 🇮🇹 with interests in:

- 🦾  **Deep Learning**  &#8594; I'm currently focusing in learning everything about Time Series.
- 🕸  **Backend & API Development** &#8594; I like building Backends and APIs with Django, I've worked with both REST and GraphQL.
- 🤖  **Web Automation** &#8594; When possible using my knowledge with APIs, and when not, using Selenium.
- 📈  **Cryptocurrencies** &#8594; I've been learning and still am to develop on the Network Cryptos provide. Currently on Stellar ⭐. Also, I'm learning and applying Technical Analysis of Chart patterns.
- 🐞  **Security Research** &#8594; I've also had a good experience with Web/Mobile/API security research. That's because I sometimes enjoy doing Bug Bounties. See the companies that acknowledged and rewarded my security research [here](#Acknowledgments)

🌱  I've been learning for a while about code optimization and disassembly, and I still am

### 🔭  Current Projects

- Building an audience as a Technical (and soon Crypto) writer on my [Medium](https://tdep.medium.com). I've just reached 92K+ views and I'm aiming to the 100K milestone  🎯. See more about my blog and projects [here](#Blog).
- Creating a *private* trading-related project that combines an API, a Backend, and an Automation mechanism.
- Building a soon-publicly accessible API based on an automated bot.
- Working on a Chart Analytics hybrid deep learning model that uses both a CNN and an LSTM + a sentiment analysis indicator
- Writing and Collecting a series of Technical analysis on Bitcoin and other charts patterns which I intend to publish on Medium and also here

### ✍️  Blog

I've started writing about Programming on Medium in the end of 2020, after having quite a *great* I have not written seriously in months I decided to start writing again, and with quite *amazing* results I'd say. On June 28 I reached more than 2K views in a single day, and the stats are promising. I would really appreciate if you took a look at it:
